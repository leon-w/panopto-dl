-   click `Load unpacked` and select the extracted folder

## How to Use ‚ÅâÔ∏è

-   open the video streaming page for a short moment and the video will get registered
-   click the extension icon to view all detected videos. A small badge indicates the amount of videos that have been registered
    -   click the video title to copy a `ffmpeg` command that will download the video as `.mp4`
    -   paste the copied command into a command line to start the download
    -   click delete to remove the video from the list
